(this is just being kept here for context in case anyone wonders why update V1.6 of the extension and update V1.0.1 of the wrapper were late this will also be updated and referenced in the main README in case any other things happen... of if a postmortem is actually needed lol)

# Extra Important!
Recent upstream changes to the survev.io project appear to have removed or heavily restricted
client-side identity signals that this project previously relied on

As a result there is currently no reliable way to identify the local player
purely from stuff such as the engine state this directly impacts the one and only (current) feature AKA the custom skins...

I am actively investigating alternative approaches but due to the scope and complexity of the
required changes this project may not have a stable release for a while

If no clean or maintainable solution exists development may continue without the custom skins feature or the project may be archived no decision has been made at this time

(Hey! little timmy this is the time to let me know you care about the project that way if push comes to shove I can confidently decide whether or not to continue development on this client without the custom skins feature or if I should just archive and fully leave the project)

Further updates will be documented here

(also small note if you got the reference for the commit name that contains this readme update we can be friends :D)

## Update 1/19/2026 (AKA 1 day after the update)

so good news I found a fix (took a while though...) however I have made some changes the desktop wrapper will no longer share this repo with the extension version instead I have moved it to its own repo so that I can enable auto updates for it you can find the repo here if you are interested in downloading that version [you can download it here](https://github.com/chickenpoo351/chickenpoo-amazing-survev-client-desktop) however everyone else there should be no changes...

I will leave this here for a few days in case someone wonders why the update was late but after that I will move it somewhere...

(hopefully I didnt leave out any info... if I did oh well...)
