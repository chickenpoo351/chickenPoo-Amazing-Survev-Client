## Why would you need this?

well you really dont but its cool to have currently it just gives you **custom skins** but more features are on the way :D

---

## Installation Guide

### Step One

download the zip from the latest release

---

### Step Two

use a tool like 7zip or winRAR you can find the link both here if you dont have them

- [7zip (Recommended :D)](https://www.7-zip.org/)
- [winRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/)

next after downloading either of these you want to unzip the zip folder you downloaded

---

### Step Three

1. Open your browser (it should be opened anyway otherwise how are you reading this...) and go to your **extensions** or **add-ons** management page

2. Enable **Developer mode** its usually a toggle in the top right of the page

3. Click the **Load unpacked** button

4. Navigate to wherever you saved your unzipped folder and select it


there you go you're done :D enjoy the custom skins (and maybe other stuff if I add them in the future)

## Important
I know your probably itching to try out the extension but please keep reading I dont want random issues being opened because little timmy thought this does something it didnt and now he's going to make an issue in all caps saying something like 

> "**FIX THIS IT DOES NOT DO (random thing the extension was never meant to do)**"

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do the skins show for other people?**
A: **No** they do not but that shouldnt matter I mean if you can see it who cares if anyone else can (plus theres only two skins in the loadout right now so this has to be better than that)

---

**Q: Does this extension do (insert random feature that wasnt listed at the top)?**
A: **No** unless its listed at the top it does not do this

---

**Q: Why doesnt it work after a update?**
A: this happens because after a update the file names and variables of the game are moved around please be patient after a update I will go as fast as I can to fix it in the meanwhile though I recommend disabling the extension until it is updated

---

**Q: Why does the extension have so many errors?**
A: this is because for some reason in the original files there are a few errors that happen and since the extension has to patch those files for them to work the errors get passed on to the extension do not worry though they are **harmless**

---

**Q: Is this some type of hack?**
A: **No** this extension will never have any type of hacking capabilities due to the fact I am actualy a decent human being and there should never be a need to hack in a game in the first place let alone a browser game... (not to mention thats a pretty good way to get malware... but I guess if your not deterred from using hacks in this message nothing will... well maybe getting banned from survev will...)

---

**Q: Does this make me cooler than my friends?**
A: **Yes** it makes you unimaginably cooler than your friends (your welcome :D)

---

**Q: I found a bug! what do I do now?**
A: Easy just report it here on github and I will fix it when I get around to it

---

**Q: Will this get me banned from survev.io?**
A: **Nope** at least it shouldnt but if a mod bans you for looking too stylish sorry I guess...

---

**Q: Does this work on (insert whatever non-chromium based browser your using)?**
A: **Sadly no...** it only works on chromium based browsers for now but I will work on a non-chromium browser version eventually...

---

**Q: Can this run on my toaster?**
A: Of course it can provided you can download files on it and it runs a chromium based browser

---

**Q: How do I remove the extension?**
A: Easy you simply go to your extension or add-on manager page in your browser and remove it or you can temporarily turn it off if needed (but why would you ever delete the extension... surely its not because the outfits look too good...)

---

**Q: Can I contribute to this by making my own custom skin?**
A: Of course! I would love if you came up with your own custom skin and contributed to the extension please refer down to the contributing section for information on how to do so

---

- Thats it for now if you have a question you simply can't think of the answer for then feel free to open a issue just make sure your not being a little timmy...

## How to Contribute

---

Whats that? You want to make your own custom skin and have it added to the extension? Thats great! keep reading to figure out how you can do this

(im still working on the instructions for this please be patient until I make them then you can start contributing :D)

---

## Repacking the Extension

---

Hold on a minute little timmy I know you want to make your own extension and thought it was probably a good idea to just clone this one and add a few things right?

well I have no problem against that as long as your not simply cloning the extension and giving it a different name then saying you made it... that's sad I spent a lot of time working on this...

if you do clone this to make your own extension I would appreciate if you gave me credit and linked back to this repo thanks :D

---

## Wow, You Made It This Far?

Thank you for reading this hopefully all your questions and other stuff have been answered enjoy the extension more features will be on the way!
